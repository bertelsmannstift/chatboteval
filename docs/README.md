# chatboteval Documentation

## What This Is

An open-source Python framework for evaluating RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) chatbots. Combines a **human annotation interface** for domain experts to label query-response pairs, an **AI workflow for query generation and variation**, and an **automated evaluation pipeline** using transformer-based models for reference-based and reference-free evaluation.

## Core Components

1. **Query Generation** — AI workflow for synthetic query generation and variation
2. **Annotation Interface** — Web-based UI where reviewers label query-response pairs
3. **Evaluation Framework** — Reproducible ML pipeline for training and inference on evaluation models
